# Excel To VCF Telegram Bot

This is a simple and efficient Telegram bot designed to convert Excel (.xlsx) contact files into VCF (.vcf) files that can be easily imported into your phone contacts. ðŸ“‹âœ¨

## How to Use the Bot (For Users)

- Add the bot on Telegram:
  ```bash
  @excel_convert_vcf_bot
  ```
- Start the bot by typing `/start`.
- Prepare an Excel (.xlsx) file with contact information in this format:
  - `Name` (required) or separate columns: `First Name`, `Middle Name`, `Last Name`
  - `Phone` (required)
  - `Email` (optional)
- Send the Excel file to the bot.
- The bot will convert it into a VCF file and send it back. ðŸŽ‰

  ```bash
